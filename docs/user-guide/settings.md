# Settings

Open settings with `Cmd+,` (**Muxy -> Settings...**). Use search at the top to find settings by name.

## App

- **Update Channel** — stable releases or beta builds.
- **Confirm Quit** — asks before quitting Muxy.
- **Crash Reports** — controls anonymous crash report consent when diagnostics are available.

## Projects

- **Project Picker** — use Muxy's picker or the Finder picker.
- **Project Picker Search Location** — folder recursively searched by Muxy's picker.
- **Keep Projects Open** — keeps projects in the sidebar after closing the last tab.
- **Default Opener** — chooses the IDE or extension opener for files opened from native surfaces.
- **Default Worktree Path** — parent folder for new worktrees.

## Remote Devices

- Add and manage reusable SSH connections for remote workspaces.
- Configure `KEY=value` environment variables exported before remote terminals, git, files, worktrees, and extension commands run. New SSH devices default to `TERM=xterm-256color`.

## Interface

- **Interface Size** — controls app density across Default, Large, Extra Large, and Huge. Scales fonts, spacing, icons, and the status bar.
- **Tab header width** — controls maximum tab header width.
- **Show Status Bar** — shows or hides the bottom status bar.
- **Show Resource Usage in Status Bar** — shows CPU and memory usage; disabling it stops sampling.
- **Light Terminal Theme** and **Dark Terminal Theme** — paired terminal themes that follow macOS appearance.
- **Sidebar Vibrancy** — on by default; uses theme-tinted native macOS vibrancy across the sidebar and its traffic-light/title strip. Turn it off for a solid theme background. The main topbar keeps the active theme background.
- **Auto-expand Worktrees** — reveals worktrees when switching projects.
- **Show Home** — shows the permanent Home project at the top of the sidebar.
- **Active Sidebar** — chooses the built-in sidebar or one provided by an extension.
- **Collapsed Sidebar Style** and **Expanded Sidebar Style** — controls sidebar presentation.
- **Worktree switcher options** — unread indicators and recent-use ordering.

See [Themes](../features/themes.md).

## Terminal

- **Auto-copy Terminal Selection** — copies terminal selections when the mouse is released.
- **Confirm Running Process Tab Close** — asks before closing a terminal tab with a running process.
- Terminal config is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/ghostty.conf` and can be opened from the Muxy menu.

## Browser

- Enable or disable the built-in browser.
- Choose whether terminal links open in the built-in browser.
- Choose search engine and home page.

## Rich Input

## Shortcuts

- Remap app actions with the key-capture recorder.

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

See [Terminal](../features/terminal.md#custom-command-shortcuts).

## Voice

See [Voice Recording](../features/voice-recording.md).

## Notifications

- **Desktop notifications** — show a macOS notification when Muxy is not frontmost.
- **Toast position** and **Sound** — delivery presentation.
- **AI Providers** — enable or disable hook integrations for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Droid, Grok, OpenCode, and Pi.

## JSON

The JSON tab exposes editable settings as `settings.json`.

Use it for bulk edits, sharing settings, or editing values faster than clicking through controls. Muxy validates the file before applying it.
